I was given 3 files - test.txt: 27 bytes, alice29.txt: 152 KB, and largefile.dat: 512.3MB
My task was to read all the 3 files and reverse them into a folder called "Output" within the project file. 
The largefile.dat which is a 512mb file should be read under 1.2secs.
I have used Java IO API to read from the files , reverse them and write to another file.
